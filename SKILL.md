# Recovery Framework Application

Translate twelve-step recovery principles to non-addiction life challenges, using concepts like powerlessness, inventory, amends, and service to navigate ego struggles, relationship conflicts, and control issues.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Replace professional addiction treatment
- Diagnose addiction or mental health conditions
- Claim this is a substitute for medical or therapeutic care
- Force framework on those who find it unhelpful

**Important:** This skill applies recovery philosophy to general life challenges. For actual addiction, encourage professional support and appropriate programs.

## When to Use

- Struggling to let go of control over outcomes
- Ego blocking learning or growth
- Relationship conflicts where you want to "win"
- Career setbacks that feel personal
- Patterns of behavior you want to change
- When someone asks "How do I let go?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Challenge | Yes | The life situation causing difficulty |
| What you're trying to control | Yes | The outcome, person, or situation you're gripping |
| Pattern recognition | No | Whether this is recurring or one-time |
| Relationships affected | No | Who has been impacted by this pattern |

## The Framework

### Step 1: Admit Powerlessness (Recovery Step 1)

**Original context:** Admitting powerlessness over substances.
**Life application:** Accepting what you cannot control.

**Questions to ask:**
- What am I trying to control that isn't mine to control?
- What would happen if I stopped trying to force this outcome?
- What is actually within my control here?

**Template:** "I cannot control [other person's reaction / external outcome / what people think]. I can only control [my own behavior / my response / my effort]."

**Key insight:** Powerlessness isn't defeat. It's focusing energy where it can actually work.

### Step 2: Take Inventory (Recovery Step 4)

**Original context:** Searching moral inventory of wrongs.
**Life application:** Ongoing examination of patterns and defects.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's my part in this? (Not the whole thing - just your part)
- What pattern am I repeating?
- What do I not want to see about myself here?
- What would someone who knows me well say is really going on?

**Template:** "In this situation, my part is [specific behavior/attitude/choice]. This connects to a pattern where I [recurring dynamic]."

**Key insight:** You can't change what you won't examine.

### Step 3: Make Amends (Recovery Step 9)

**Original context:** Making direct amends to those harmed.
**Life application:** Active repair of relationships damaged by your behavior.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who has been affected by my actions?
- What would genuine repair look like (not just apology)?
- Can I make amends without causing additional harm?
- What behavior change demonstrates the amends?

**Template:** "I [specific action that caused harm]. I'm sorry. To make this right, I'm going to [concrete action], and I'm working on [behavioral change]."

**Key insight:** Amends aren't apologies. They're repairs. They require changed behavior.

### Step 4: Be of Service (Recovery Step 12)

**Original context:** Helping others with their addiction.
**Life application:** Service as essential to own growth.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who could benefit from what I've learned?
- How can I turn my struggle into help for others?
- What would I tell someone going through the same thing?
- How does helping others help me?

**Template:** "Because I've been through [struggle], I can help with [specific support] for people dealing with [similar challenge]."

**Key insight:** Getting outside yourself is sometimes the fastest way to get through yourself.

## Daily Practice Application

Recovery isn't a destination. It's daily maintenance.

**Morning practice:**
- Brief inventory: What am I carrying into today? What needs attention?
- Identify control traps: Where am I likely to try to force outcomes?
- Service intention: How can I be useful to someone today?

**Evening practice:**
- What happened today that triggered me?
- Did I stay in my lane (control what I can)?
- Do I owe anyone an amends?
- What am I grateful for?

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reframe | Shift from control-seeking to acceptance of powerlessness over specific outcomes |
| Inventory | Honest examination of your part in the situation |
| Amends plan | Concrete steps to repair relationships if needed |
| Service opportunity | Way to turn struggle into help for others |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person is dealing with actual addiction | Direct to professional resources; don't treat life-application framework as treatment |
| Inventory reveals nothing | Dig deeper, or accept that this particular issue may not be about your patterns |
| Amends would cause more harm | Some amends are better left unmade; focus on changed behavior instead |
| Person rejects the framework | That's valid; this approach isn't for everyone. Offer alternatives. |

## Example

**Challenge:** "I'm furious that my coworker got the promotion I deserved."

**Recovery Framework Application:**

**Step 1 - Powerlessness:**
"What can I control here? Not the decision that was made. Not my coworker. Not how my boss perceives things. I can control my response, my future effort, and whether I let this make me bitter or use it as information.

Let me accept that the outcome wasn't mine to control."

**Step 2 - Inventory:**
"What's my part? Honestly? I didn't advocate for myself as strongly as I could have. I assumed my work would speak for itself. I've done this before - expected recognition without asking for it, then felt resentful when it didn't come.

The pattern is: I want credit without having to ask for it. That's ego."

**Step 3 - Amends:**
"Have I harmed anyone? I've been short with my coworker since the announcement. That's not fair to them - they didn't do anything wrong. I need to congratulate them genuinely and stop making them feel guilty for succeeding."

**Step 4 - Service:**
"What can I offer? I've been here longer than some newer employees. I could mentor someone who's trying to advance. That would get me outside my own head and contribute something useful.

Also: I can share with someone else what I'm learning about self-advocacy."

## Skill Boundaries

- **This is philosophy, not treatment.** For addiction or mental health crises, professional support is essential.
- **Take what works, leave the rest.** Twelve-step principles aren't for everyone. That's okay.
- **This is an ongoing practice.** You don't graduate. You maintain.
- **Don't use this to fix others.** Apply it to yourself first and foremost.

**Remember:** The goal isn't perfection. The goal is progress. Every day you choose to do the work is a day you stay in recovery from whatever pattern you're working on. Some days you'll fail. The practice is coming back.
